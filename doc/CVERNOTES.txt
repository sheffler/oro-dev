CVER notes

- only ONE instance of $apvm() is allowed in a Verilog sim.  Reason is
  described below.  Still trying to find a good workaround.

- vpi_put_userdata is not yet allowed during the compile phase, which is
  when APVM wants to associate the systf_h with our userdata.  Current
  workaround is to use apvm_put/get_userdata instead.
