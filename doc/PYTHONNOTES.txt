Building Python properly is a prerequisite for getting APVM to build
and operate properly.

Environment Variables

  If when starting up APVM, the Python interpreter complains about not
  being able to find standard libraries then the Python configuration
  environment variables must be set explicitly.

  Some of these problems may be ameliorated by using the --prefix argument
  to "configure" properly.

  The path list for the standard libraries can be discovered by
  invoking Python and printing sys.path.  You can then use this list
  to construct the path list.

  Some installations may need to set PYTHONHOME too.


Linking APVM

  Determining the correct set of libraries that must be linked with
  libpython2.x.a to form a working Python can be a challenge.  For my
  Redhat 9 installation of Python 2.3, this list is

	-ldl -lpthread -lutil -lm -ltix8.1.8.3 -ltk8.3 -ltcl8.3 

  If you  have built the Python executable, you can look in the
  Makefile or the output of the make command for the target "python."

  The Python "distutils" package can be used to extract this
  information for your Python installation.
