VCS offers its own challenges for compilation.  Here are just a few
notes that may help.

- When building Python, statically link all standard modules,
  especially those for math and random.  Follow directions for
  building Python at the end of doc/DYNNOTES.txt

- You must determine all libraries that Python needs. Here is a
  command line that worked at one site.

% vcs -R -lpthread -lm -ldl -ltk8.3 -ltcl8.3 -lutil +vpi ../src/libapvmvpi.a -P ../src/apvm.tab /usr/lib/python2.2/config/libpython2.2.a +plusarg_save +option1=value1 +flag1 +apvm:debug=1 -f plusargs.f plusargs.v
